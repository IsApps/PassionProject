# PassionProject
This is my code for my project. I used elements of user interaction, different shapes and different game mechanics to make this game.

# Controls
Use the left arrow to move the rectangle to the left and use the right arrow key to move the rectangle to the right side.
The aim of the game is to minimize how many times the ball touches the rectangle! Be careful since the ball could come at different speeds and times.
