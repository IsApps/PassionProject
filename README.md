# Project Inspiration and Introduction
This is my code for my project. I used elements of user interaction, different shapes and different game mechanics to make this game. This code is based off numerous already made collision games, and I gained inspiration for this project off of Space Invaders. I made the ball present itself at a random size and speed to emulate a feeeling of shooting a ball (like Space Invaders). The hoop is used for dodging the ball. Since the ball can bounce off the different frames and walls, you need to be careful regarding where the ball can land. 

# Controls
Use the left arrow to move the rectangle to the left and use the right arrow key to move the rectangle to the right side.
The aim of the game is to minimize how many times the ball touches the rectangle! Be careful since the ball could come at different speeds and times. These are the main controls of the game and the only ones that you need.

# Physics
There are numerous different aspects of physics that is used in my game. For one, I used different forces and other moving factors so that the ball can bounce while in frame. This works to help the ball remain in frame. Another aspects that I had added was the change in the momentum of the ball. This is a cool aspect because the ball can bounce off the wall at different rates.
